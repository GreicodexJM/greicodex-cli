# ðŸ“˜ Active Context â€” GRX CLI

## 1. Current Work Focus
The scaffolding logic has been refactored to use Go's `text/template` engine. This change simplifies template creation and maintenance by allowing the use of placeholders and expressions, making the templates more dynamic and powerful. The immediate focus is to add more built-in stacks using this new templating system.

**Immediate Goals:**
1.  **Add more built-in stacks** and templates to the registry using the new template engine.
2.  **Expand the `verify` command's checks** further.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Decision:** Reverted the scaffolding logic to use Go's `text/template` engine.
- **Reasoning:** This simplifies template creation and maintenance, and makes the templates more powerful and flexible.
- **Decision:** Added **unit tests** for the `scaffolder.Service`.
- **Reasoning:** This ensures the quality and maintainability of the CLI's core scaffolding logic.
- **Decision:** Added **unit tests** for the `verifier.Service`, achieving >80% coverage.

## 3. Next Steps
- **Add a `persistence` stack** for MySQL to the internal registry.
- **Add a `deployment` stack** for Serverless to the internal registry.

## 4. Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Test-Driven Development:** Core logic should be accompanied by robust unit tests.
- **Single Binary:** The CLI should be a self-contained, single executable.

# ðŸ“˜ Active Context â€” GRX CLI

## 1. Current Work Focus
Unit tests have been added for the `verifier.Service`, achieving **85% code coverage** for that package. This establishes a strong testing foundation. The immediate focus is to continue expanding the CLI's capabilities by adding more built-in stacks.

**Immediate Goals:**
1.  **Add more built-in stacks** and templates to the registry.
2.  **Expand the `verify` command's checks** further.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Decision:** Added **unit tests** for the `verifier.Service`, achieving >80% coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This ensures the quality and maintainability of the CLI's core verification logic and serves as a foundation for future testing efforts.
- **Decision:** Expanded the `verify` command to include recipe-aware checks for the linter, persistence, and deployment layers.

## 3. Next Steps
- **Add a `persistence` stack** for MySQL to the internal registry.
- **Add a `deployment` stack** for Serverless to the internal registry.

## 4. Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Test-Driven Development:** Core logic should be accompanied by robust unit tests.
- **Single Binary:** The CLI should be a self-contained, single executable.

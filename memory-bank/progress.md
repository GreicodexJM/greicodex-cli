# ðŸ“˜ Progress â€” GRX CLI

## 1. Current Status
**Phase 1 - Core CLI (In Progress)**

The project has a solid foundation. The `init` command has been significantly reworked to be an interactive TUI that generates a `grei.yml` project recipe file. This recipe is the cornerstone for making the other commands context-aware.

### What Works
- **Project Documentation:** The `memory-bank` is fully initialized.
- **`grei init` command:**
  - [x] Interactive TUI for collecting project settings.
  - [x] Generates a `grei.yml` recipe file.
  - [x] Prevents re-initialization of existing projects.
  - [x] Placeholder for template scaffolding.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1)
- **`grei verify` command:**
  - [ ] Read the `grei.yml` file.
  - [ ] Implement linter detection based on the recipe.
  - [ ] Expand coverage parsing for other languages.
  - [ ] Add verification for CI/CD, Helm, and OpenTofu configurations.
- **`grei install-hooks` command:**
  - [ ] Implement logic to configure `core.hooksPath`.
  - [ ] Ensure hooks are marked as executable.
- **Template Scaffolding:**
  - [ ] Implement the actual logic to copy templates based on the `grei.yml` recipe.
- **Output Formatting:**
  - [ ] Implement ANSI output for human-readable reports.
  - [ ] Implement JSON output for CI/CD integration.

## 2. Known Issues
- None at this time.

## 3. Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Decision:** The project will be built in Go using the Cobra framework and will follow a Hexagonal Architecture.
  - **Reasoning:** This stack was chosen to create a performant, maintainable, and easily testable single-binary CLI.
- **Pivotal Change:** The concept of a `grei.yml` **Project Recipe** was introduced.
  - **Reasoning:** This makes the CLI's behavior explicit and configurable, rather than relying on implicit checks. It provides a single source of truth for project configuration, which is invaluable for both human developers and automated tools/AI agents.

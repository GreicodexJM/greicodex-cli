# ðŸ“˜ Progress â€” GRX CLI

## 1. Current Status
**Phase 1 - Core CLI (In Progress)**

Test coverage has been added to the project's `Makefile`, improving the project's own quality and standards.

### What Works
- **Project Documentation:** The `memory-bank` is fully up-to-date.
- **Internal Stack Registry:**
  - [x] A central registry defines all available stacks.
- **`grei init` command:**
  - [x] Implements a fully compositional survey.
  - [x] Generates a rich `grei.yml` recipe file.
  - [x] Scaffolds initial project templates.
- **`grei verify` command:**
  - [x] Reads the `grei.yml` file.
  - [x] Performs recipe-aware checks for the linter, persistence, and deployment layers.
- **Development Lifecycle:**
    - [x] `Makefile` includes a `coverage` target to run tests and generate a coverage report.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1)
- **Expand `verify` Checks:**
  - [ ] Add other recipe-aware checks.
- **Expand Template Scaffolding:**
  - [ ] Add more stack-specific templates.
- **Add More Stacks:**
    - [ ] Add a `persistence` stack for MySQL.

## 2. Known Issues
- The `verify` command's recipe integration is currently basic and needs to be expanded with more checks.
- Template scaffolding is not yet implemented for the new `deployment` stacks.

## 3. Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Pivotal Change:** Added **test coverage** to the project's own `Makefile`.
  - **Reasoning:** This is a critical step in "dogfooding" the CLI and ensuring it adheres to the same high standards it will enforce on other projects.

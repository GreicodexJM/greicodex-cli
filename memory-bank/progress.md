# ðŸ“˜ Progress â€” GRX CLI

## 1. Current Status
**Phase 1 - Core CLI (In Progress)**

The project is in the initial setup phase. The `memory-bank` has been established, providing a clear foundation for the project's goals, architecture, and technical decisions. The next step is to create the Go project structure and begin implementing the core commands.

### What Works
- **Project Documentation:** The `memory-bank` is fully initialized with the following documents:
  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
  - `activeContext.md`

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1)
- **Go Project Structure:** The directory layout needs to be created.
- **`grei init` command:**
  - [ ] Create the command using Cobra.
  - [ ] Implement the logic to copy embedded templates.
  - [ ] Embed initial templates (`README.md`, `.gitignore`, etc.).
- **`grei verify` command:**
  - [ ] Implement secret scanning (regex fallback).
  - [ ] Add linter detection.
  - [ ] Implement test execution and coverage parsing.
  - [ ] Add verification for CI/CD, Helm, and OpenTofu configurations.
- **`grei install-hooks` command:**
  - [ ] Implement logic to configure `core.hooksPath`.
  - [ ] Ensure hooks are marked as executable.
- **Output Formatting:**
  - [ ] Implement ANSI output for human-readable reports.
  - [ ] Implement JSON output for CI/CD integration.

## 2. Known Issues
- None at this time.

## 3. Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Decision:** The project will be built in Go using the Cobra framework and will follow a Hexagonal Architecture.
  - **Reasoning:** This stack was chosen to create a performant, maintainable, and easily testable single-binary CLI, which aligns with the project's goals of simplicity and reproducibility.

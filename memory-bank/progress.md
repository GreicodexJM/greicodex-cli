# ðŸ“˜ Progress â€” GRX CLI

## 1. Current Status
**Phase 1 - Core CLI (In Progress)**

Unit tests have been added for the `verifier.Service`, achieving **85% code coverage** for that package. This establishes a strong testing foundation for the CLI's core logic.

### What Works
- **Project Documentation:** The `memory-bank` is fully up-to-date.
- **Internal Stack Registry:**
  - [x] A central registry defines all available stacks.
- **`grei init` command:**
  - [x] Implements a fully compositional survey.
  - [x] Generates a rich `grei.yml` recipe file.
  - [x] Scaffolds initial project templates.
- **`grei verify` command:**
  - [x] Reads the `grei.yml` file.
  - [x] Performs recipe-aware checks for the linter, persistence, and deployment layers.
- **Testing:**
    - [x] The `verifier` package has >80% test coverage.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1)
- **Expand `verify` Checks:**
  - [ ] Add other recipe-aware checks.
- **Expand Template Scaffolding:**
  - [ ] Add more stack-specific templates.
- **Add More Stacks:**
    - [ ] Add a `persistence` stack for MySQL.

## 2. Known Issues
- Overall test coverage for the project is still low, but the most critical core logic is now well-tested.

## 3. Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Pivotal Change:** Added **unit tests** for the `verifier.Service`.
  - **Reasoning:** This ensures the quality and maintainability of the CLI's core verification logic and serves as a foundation for future testing efforts.
